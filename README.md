# Iris-Species-Classification
This is a self project I have done to get better understanding of data visualization and machine learning libraries. 
Performed exploratory data analysis with the help of pandas, matplotlib and seaborn library for visualisation of data 
(scatter plot, pair plot, contour plot, histogram, pdf, cdf and box plot with wishkers) 
Trained logistic regression models using sklearn library.
